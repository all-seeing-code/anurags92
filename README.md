# Anurag Sharma
Hi, I'm Anurag -- a software engineer. I work at [Dgraph Labs](https://dgraph.io/) building a distributed graph database. My work lies at the intersection of concurrency patterns, query latency and graph algorithms. Previously I worked at Goldman Sachs as a quant building pricing models for interest rate derivatives. 

I geek out on literature, history, databases and probabilities.
