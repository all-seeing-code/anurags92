Hr√¶zlean wasteland, I am the forefather.
Mine one eye seeks wisdom's crevices.
My ravens whispers secrets wisdom brings.
Heed my word, mortal, if thee wishes knows:
Work hard, fight brave, think smart, speak true,
And someday thee shall see what now lies unseen.
Pay price of sacrifice, suffer paths of pain,
But rewards of runes await at journey's end.
Train mind like muscle, hone skills like steel.
Keep heart like hearth, warming all in gloom.
Make old foe friend, help weak where can.
Do right over easy, kindness over wrath.
Only then may thee grasp Gungir's golden hilt,
And sit throne where now One Eye sits alone.
